# Database Actions - ORDS

## Introduction

This lab explains how to install Oracle Rest Data Services (ORDS) on a VM or compute instance running Linux, enable a schema, and log in to the Database Actions console.

The lab covers the preparation and the steps for installing *ORDS 24.1*.

## Get the installers

Download these using a web browser or from a terminal using CLI.

1. **Java 17**
1. **ORDS 24.1**
1. **Oracle Database**
1. **Sample schemas 23c**

	----
	## Links and steps to download

	The version of these packages depends on the ORDS version that you want to install. 

	1. **Java 17**: Get the installer, *`jdk-17_linux-x64_bin.rpm`*.

		 - From the [download site](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) or using CLI - 

			```
			$ <copy>wget https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_linux-x64_bin.rpm</copy>
			```

	1. **ORDS 24.1**: Get the installer, *`ords-24.1.0.108.0942.zip`* dated April 23, 2024.

		 - From the [download site](https://www.oracle.com/technologies/appdev/rest-data-services-downloads-24.1.html) or using CLI - 

			```
			$ <copy>wget https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/java/ords/ords-24.1.0.108.0942.zip</copy>
			```

		> Oracle REST Data Services JDBC driver is not required.

	1. **Oracle Database**: Get the installer for the required database version, for example, 21c *`LINUX.X64_213000_db_home.zip`*. 

		 - For example,  

			```
			$ <copy>https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/oracle21c-linux-downloads.html#license-lightbox</copy>
			```

		> Requires an Oracle account or SSO to download.

	1. **Sample schemas 23c**: Get the source code file, `db-sample-schemas-23.3.zip`

		 - From the GitHub [download site](https://github.com/oracle-samples/db-sample-schemas/releases) or using CLI - 

			```
			$ <copy>wget https://github.com/oracle-samples/db-sample-schemas/archive/refs/tags/v23.3.zip</copy>
			```

## Prepare for installation

1. Install Java
1. Extract the ORDS installer
1. Install Oracle Database
1. Check PDB details

	----
	## 1. Install Java

	1. Verify that the system has *Java 17* installed and the *`PATH`* variable set up. 

		```
		$ <copy>java -version</copy>
		```

		```
		java version "17.0.12" 20YY-MM-DD LTS
		Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.12+8-LTS-286)
		Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0.12+8-LTS-286, mixed mode, sharing)
		```

		If it displays an older version of Java, for example, 1.0.8 or says Java is not installed, then install or upgrade Java. Skip the next step if Java 17 is already installed.

	1. Go to the folder that contains the Java RPM installer and run the installer. 

		```
		$ <copy>rpm -ivh jdk-17_linux-x64_bin.rpm</copy>
		```

		Here,

		 - *i* - installs the package
		 - *v* - stands for verbose and displays the detailed output
		 - *h* - prints hash marks to indicate the progress

	Open a new terminal and verify the Java version.

	----
	## 2. Extract the ORDS installer

	1. Create a folder *`ords`* and a subfolder *`conf`* where you want to install, for example, under `~/Downloads`.

		```
		$ <copy>mkdir -p ~/Downloads/ords/conf</copy>
		```

	1. Extract the ORDS installer (`*.zip`) into `~/Download/ords`.

		```
		$ unzip -q ords-24.1.0.108.0942.zip -d ~/Downloads/ords
		```

	----
	## 3. Install Oracle Database

	Download and install Oracle Database, for example 21c (21.3) - *`LINUX.X64_213000_db_home.zip`*, if not already installed. 

	Refer [this lab](https://manish-garodia.github.io/mg-playground/topic-title/oracle-db/).

	Skip this if Oracle Database is already installed. 

	----
	## 4. Check PDB details

	Check the listener configuration to know the PDB service name and the port number. 
	
	1. Set the environment variables, `$ORACLE_HOME` and `$ORACLE_SID`.
	
	1. Go to `$ORACLE_HOME/bin` and view the listener status.

		```
		[ORACLE_HOME/bin]$ <copy>./lsnrctl status</copy>
		```

	 - It returns listener configuration and displays the PDB service name, for example, *`orclpdb.us.oracle.com`* and the port, for example, `1522` where the PDB service is running.

		> **Note**: If the listener does not know of the PDB, then ORDS installation exists with an error - <i>Listener refused the connection, listener does not know of the service `[pdb-name]`</i>. 

		----
		## Register PDB with Listener

		Add PDB details to `tnsnames.ora`, restart the database, and open all PDBs.

		1. 	Go to the location under `$ORACLE_BASE` where the network configuration files reside. 

		1. 	Check the contents of `listener.ora`, `sqlnet.ora`, and `tnsnames.ora`.

			- *`listener.ora`* - 

				```
				$ <copy>cat listener.ora</copy>
				```

				```
				# listener.ora Network Configuration File: /u01/app/oracle/homes/OraDB21Home1/network/admin/listener.ora
				# Generated by Oracle configuration tools.

				LISTENER=
				  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
					(DESCRIPTION =
					  (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = [hostname])(PORT = 1522))
					  (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1522))
					)
				  )
				```

			- *`sqlnet.ora`* - 

				```
				$ <copy>cat sqlnet.ora</copy>
				```

				```
				# sqlnet.ora Network Configuration File: /u01/app/oracle/homes/OraDB21Home1/network/admin/sqlnet.ora
				# Generated by Oracle configuration tools.

				NAMES.DIRECTORY_PATH= (TNSNAMES, EZCONNECT)
				```

			- *`tnsnames.ora`* - 

				```
				$ <copy>cat tnsnames.ora</copy>
				```

				```
				# tnsnames.ora Network Configuration File: /u01/app/oracle/database/homes/OraDB21Home1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora
				# Generated by Oracle configuration tools.

				LISTENER_ORCL =
				  (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = [hostname])(PORT = 1522))


				ORCL =
				  (DESCRIPTION =
					(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = [hostname])(PORT = 1522))
					(CONNECT_DATA =
					  (SERVER = DEDICATED)
					  (SERVICE_NAME = orcl.us.oracle.com)
					)
				  )

				ORCLPDB =
				  (DESCRIPTION =
					(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = [hostname])(PORT = 1522))
					(CONNECT_DATA =
					  (SERVER = DEDICATED)
					  (SERVICE_NAME = orclpdb.us.oracle.com)
					)
				  )
				```

				If `tnsnames.ora` does not contain the PDB, add the PDB.

				A. Open `tnsnames.ora` in a text editor. 

				```
				$ <copy>vi tnsnames.ora</copy>
				```

				B. Press *`i`* to enter into the **Insert** mode. 

				C. Add PDB information similar to this. Update the port number, if required.

				```
				ORCLPDB =
				  (DESCRIPTION =
					(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = [hostname])(PORT = 1522))
					(CONNECT_DATA =
					  (SERVER = DEDICATED)
					  (SERVICE_NAME = orclpdb.us.oracle.com)
					)
				  )
				```

				Press **Esc** followed by **:wq** to save and close the file.

		1. Set the environment variables `$ORACLE_HOME` and `$ORACLE_SID`. Log in to the SQL prompt as `SYSDBA`. 

			```
			[ORACLE_HOME/bin]$ <copy>sqlplus / as sysdba</copy>
			```

		1. From the SQL prompt, close the database. 

			```
			SQL> <copy>shutdown immediate</copy>
			```

			```
			Database closed.
			Database dismounted.
			ORACLE instance shut down.
			```

		1. Start the database.

			```
			SQL> <copy>startup</copy>
			```

			```
			ORACLE instance started.

			Total System Global Area 1.0033E+10 bytes
			Fixed Size		        9696192 bytes
			Variable Size		 1509949440 bytes
			Database Buffers	 8489271296 bytes
			Redo Buffers		   23855104 bytes
			Database mounted.
			```

		1. Open the PDB or all PDBs.

			```
			SQL> <copy>alter pluggable database all open;</copy>

			Pluggable database altered.
			```

		Now, check the listener status again. 

		```
		[ORACLE_HOME/bin]$ <copy>./lsnrctl status</copy>
		```

		This time the listener configuration shows the PDB service is registered and running on the specified port. Note the PDB service name and the port number.

		> **Important**: If listener does not show `orcl` and the PDB service, it may be because the listener has been running for a previously installed database, and for 21c, the network configuration files are not created. Hence, create the files manually - `listener.ora`, `tnsnames.ora`, and `sqlnet.ora` in the Oracle Base directory `$ORACLE_BASE/homes/OraDB21Home1/network/admin` and copy the service names. Restart the database and open the PDB to let the listener know of the services.

## ORDS Installation

		> **Note**: If the response at the end shows *`INVALID`*, then the Database Action login page does not open. 

	Congratulations! You have installed ORDS in the PDB. Leave the terminal and the ORDS service running to access the Database Actions login page.

	Enable a schema in the PDB, if not already done, and use its credentials to log in to the Database Actions console. 

## Postinstallation tasks

 - Install a schema
 - Enable REST services for the schema
 - Stop ORDS and restart

	> If you already have the schema installed or the user created in the PDB, you can enable that schema. On the other hand, you can install a new schema in the PDB. 

	----
	## Install a schema

	These steps will install the `HR` schema in the PDB.

	1. Set the environment variables `$ORACLE_HOME` and `$ORACLE_SID`. Log in to the SQL prompt as `SYSDBA`. 

		```
		[ORACLE_HOME/bin]$ <copy>sqlplus / as sysdba</copy>
		```

	1. Change the container to PDB.

		```
		SQL> <copy>alter session set container=orclpdb;</copy>
		```

	1. Install the required schema, for example, the *`hr`* schema. 

		**Syntax**

		```
		SQL> @ [path-to-schema.sql]
		```

		Example

		```
		SQL> <copy>@ /home/oracle/Downloads/db-sample-schemas-23.3/human_resources/hr_install.sql</copy>
		```

		```
		Thank you for installing the Oracle Human Resources Sample Schema.
		This installation script will automatically exit your database session
		at the end of the installation or if any error is encountered.
		The entire installation will be logged into the 'hr_install.log' log file.
		```

	1.	Specify a password for the user and select the tablespace. 

		```
		Enter a password for the user HR: oracle
		Enter a tablespace for HR [USERS]: 
		```

		- If the schema already exists, enter `YES` to overwrite it. 

			```
			Do you want to overwrite the schema, if it already exists? [YES|no]: Enter YES
			```
